# Synto

This is an experimental library designed to make it easy to construct Syntax Trees. It does this by using a source-generator that turns syntax-trees as parsed by the compiler and "quotes" them to expose the syntax tree itself in your code.

See test/Synto.Test/Samples.cs for some simple examples of what currently works.
